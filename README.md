###Something small about me 

Information studies graduate, University of Ghana, having keen interest in CyberSecurity, programming languages, and technology in general. I am a little fluent in python, javascript, php etc. and I have good technical and analytical skills. I have tried many ctfs like hackthissite, overthewireshark, embedded security. I learnt how to deploy pods using Kubernetes, learnt splunk: basics, Qradar:basics, Windows Sysmon/ Event viewer, SIEM and SOAR, Windows - Process Injection IR (Splunk) during my studies at RangeForceCommunity edition. I have also gone through course materials and practice labs of Portswigger Web Security Academy, which has really helped me in my bug bounty journey. 

**Motivation and Purpose**

In 2020, after I had graduated from high school, I realized I was interested in cyber security but was unsure about the subject to offer at the university since my educational path wasn't focused on Information technology or computer science. This made it difficult for me to break into the tech field. Meanwhile, I was taking Zaid Security's programming (python) and ethical hacking courses, which I found to be quite intriguing. 
After that, I continued to take free online courses and took part in ctfs (capture the flag). This made me break into the cybersecurity field and I started exploring. In my exploration, I realized that there are many career paths in Cyber Security which needs more attention and expertise, this caught my interest. I became intrigued about blue teaming, threat hunting, security analyst, soc analysts roles, I found out that not many people are into this field of cyber security and this field is not as interesting as red teaming or penetration testing, thus do not have many professionals and experts which has become very concerning to me and has made me want to venture into that sector of cyber security.    

I have personally experienced security risk and hacking. I was able to grab ip-address (with other information) of 6 "social engineers" who were trying to get my seed phrase of a crypto wallet. I was able to grab information of hacker who took a friend's Instagram account, I am very happy about the successes, as these were my initial  experiences in the cybersecurity field.
I am into bug hunting at the moment for more experience, learning new skills and hoping to become better. The goal is to make a great impact, leave an indelible mark in this industry.
